# Greenbone Templates for repositories on GitHub

A collection of templates we use to keep the quality consistent over the various projects we maintain.

## README.md

We want to establish a consistent structure of the readme in our projects.

There are several projects that provide a readme template out there, for example https://www.makeareadme.com/ with a general suggestion for open source projects or the [Standard Readme Style Specification](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) especially for code modules. They differ only in details on the suggested sections. A good ressource on writing great READMEs is also [Art of README](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme).

Our template is heavily based on these two templates.

The first project using this template is [gvm-tools](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools#readme), which can be used as an example.
